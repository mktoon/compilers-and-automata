line no lex
reports abt errors in lines - yacc 
we must declare everything before using any variables
#define max 26
int regs[max];
make sure that your calculator works with the symbols table
P is defined as
P   :   P->DECLs List
    ; all the other decl
DECLS   :DECL
        ;

%token T_INT
start P;
inside lex we need to train it to accept T-INTcreate a reserver word
int {return(T_INT);}
train lex to take in a semicolon
[;()=]
int x; - this should work
int hello; - should not work
multi linked variables 
to fix this we do [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*
