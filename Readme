CMINUS+ Compiler

The CMINUS+ Compiler is a project aimed at implementing a compiler for the CMINUS+ programming language. This open-source compiler provides a comprehensive set of functionalities, including lexical analysis, syntax parsing, symbol table management, and intermediate code generation.

Key Features:

Lexical Analysis: Tokenizes the input source code using well-defined lexical rules.
Syntax Analysis: Employs a YACC parser to generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based on the CMINUS+ grammar.
Symbol Table Management: Manages a symbol table to handle variables, functions, and other program entities, ensuring proper scoping and type information.
Intermediate Code Generation: Generates intermediate code from the AST, facilitating further compilation steps.
How to Use:

Clone the Repository:
Build the Compiler:
make
Compile CMINUS+ Programs:
./cminusc input.cminus
View Generated Output:
Check the generated intermediate code in the specified output file.
